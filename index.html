            Chainsaw Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished young man who makes a contract that fuses his body
            with that of a dog-like devil named Pochita, granting him the ability to transform parts of his body into
            chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on fighting
            against devils whenever they become a threat to Japan. The second arc of the story focuses on Asa Mitaka, a
            high school student who enters into a contract with Yoru, the War Devil, who forces her to hunt down
            Chainsaw Man in order to reclaim the devils stolen from her.
